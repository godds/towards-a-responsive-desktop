# Towards A Responsive Desktop

Typically, desktop applications either ignore that screen space is at a premium or force the user to be the designer of their workspace. Why don't we actively design the best experiences for users rather than lazily making them do it? As HTML/JS is increasingly adopted for desktop application development, we must make sure we carry over the web's good design and development practices. So why don't we adopt responsive design on the desktop? Graham Odds from Scott Logic will demonstrate the power and fresh challenge of applying responsive design to desktop productivity applications.
